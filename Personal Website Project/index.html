                <p>I've cross path with coding by accident. I've study Digital animation because I love drawing and video games. My goal was to create a horse video game. Later on, I was hook with coding and what I can do for my hoses with it. That got me into learning how to build systems where I can use them to manage my family's horse farm</p>
